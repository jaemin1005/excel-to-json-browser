## Project Overview

This project is a web application designed to efficiently convert Excel files into JSON format. All file processing occurs entirely on the client side, eliminating the need for server-side data transmission or storage. Users can upload their Excel files directly through the web browser and instantly download the converted JSON files.

To enhance performance, the application utilizes WebAssembly (WASM) technology, which significantly speeds up the conversion process. This allows for rapid processing of large files, ensuring that even substantial datasets are converted quickly and efficiently.

By keeping all operations client-side, the application reduces server load and enhances data privacy and security. Users can confidently manage sensitive or large files without concerns about data exposure. Overall, this project showcases the power of client-side processing and modern web technologies to deliver fast, secure, and reliable file conversion.
